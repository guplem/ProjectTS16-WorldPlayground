# ProjectTS16-WorldPlayground

An attempt on recreating a generation of infinite procedural voxel world worlds (like in Minecraft).

I managed to create a terrain with an optimized mesh, dynamic load of chunks, different terrain biomes, ...

But the complexity of that type of world generation is gigantic, and it was very difficult to combine with other mandatory projects (such as the video game Thicc Wet Paper Layers) so the project ended up abandoned.
